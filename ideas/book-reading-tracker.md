## Overview

The Bug Tracking Project is a web application designed to help teams manage and track bugs and issues in their software development process. The application is built using the latest technologies including Next.js 14, MongoDB, Prisma, and NextAuth for authentication.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: For server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **MongoDB**: For scalable and flexible data storage.
- **Prisma**: As an ORM for managing database interactions.
- **Auth V5**: For secure user authentication.
- **Resend**: To handle email notifications.
- **React Hook Form**: For managing form state and validation.
- **Zod Validation**: For schema validation.
- **Typescript**: To ensure type safety and reduce runtime errors.
- **Shadcn Tailwind UI Library**: For building a modern, responsive UI.

## Features

1. **User Authentication**: Secure user authentication using NextAuth, supporting various providers including Google, GitHub, and email/password.
2. **Bug Reporting**: Users can report new bugs, providing details such as the bug description, severity, and steps to reproduce.
3. **Bug Tracking**: Track the status of reported bugs, assign them to team members, and update their progress.
4. **Dashboard**: A dashboard that provides an overview of the current status of all bugs, including open, in-progress, and resolved bugs.
5. **User Roles**: Different user roles (admin, developer, reporter) with varying levels of access and permissions.
6. **Search and Filter**: Advanced search and filtering options to quickly find specific bugs based on various criteria.
7. **Notifications**: Email notifications to keep users informed about updates to the bugs they reported or are assigned to.

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. Authentication Configuration: Setting up NextAuth with multiple providers can be complex. Ensure all necessary environment variables are correctly configured and providers are properly set up in next.config.js.
2. Database Integration: Configuring MongoDB with Prisma may require careful schema design and migration handling. Ensure Prisma is correctly configured and migrations are applied to avoid issues with data integrity.
3. Email Notifications: Configuring Resend for email notifications requires correct setup of API keys and email templates. Verify that emails are correctly triggered and received.
4. Form Handling: Integrating React Hook Form with Zod Validation might involve managing complex validation schemas. Ensure forms are validated correctly and handle form submission errors gracefully.

## Who This Project Is For

The Bug Tracker Project is ideal for software development teams seeking an efficient tool to manage and track bugs throughout their development cycle. It is particularly useful for:

- Development Teams: To manage and assign bugs, track progress, and collaborate effectively.
- Project Managers: To get an overview of the current status of bugs and manage resources accordingly.
- QA Engineers: To report and track bugs, ensuring they are addressed and resolved in a timely manner.
