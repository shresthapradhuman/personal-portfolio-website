Let's say you want to build an application for yourself. And you can do this in two ways. 
1. Either you can build it from scratch, writing every single line of code.
2. You can build from other code and modify them according to your needs.
But where would you get all these codes for your application? 

Here what comes in handy is a package manager. It's like a code store from where you can get a different package of code and modify it for yourself by passing attributes and values. 

So, today's topic is NPM (Node Package Manager) - which is the default package manager for Javascript runtime Node.js.

NPM consists of two things.

1. A client tool for publishing and downloading packages.

2. An online repository that hosts Javascript packages. 

 You can specify label all of your project's dependencies inside your package.json file then any time you can just run npm install and immediately have all of the dependencies installed.
