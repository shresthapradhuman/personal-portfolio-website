## As Everyone know that JavaScript is the backbone of Web Development. <br> So, today I will share 7 One-Liners of JavaScript.

1. Shuffle Array

   Very usefull snippet to shuffle array.

   ```
    const shuffleArray = (arr) => arr.sort(()=> Math.random()- 0.5);
    // Testing
    const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
    console.log(shuffleArray(arr));
   ```

2. Copy to Clipboard

   is used to copy text to clipboard.

   ```
    const copyToClipboard = (text) => navigator.clipboard ? .writeText && navigator.clipboard.writeText(text);

    // Testing
    copyToClipboard("Hello World!");
   ```

3. Unique Elements

   is used to get the unique elements from an array using the Set. JavaScript use Set for implementation of Hash List.

   ```
    const getUnique = (arr) => [...new Set(arr)];
    //Testing
    const arr = [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5]
    console.log(getUnique(arr));

   ```

4. Detect Dark Mode

   is used to switch app to dark mode if the user has it's enabled in their device. media queris are utilized for making the task.

   ```
    const isDarkMode = () =>
      window.matchMedia &&
      window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches;
    // Testing
    console.log(isDarkMode());
   ```

5. Scroll To Top

   is used to scrollIntoView mdethod.Add behaviour: "smooth for a smooth scrolling animation.

   ```
    const scrollToTop = (element) => element.scrollIntoView({ behaviour: "smooth", block: "start" });
   ```

6. Scroll To Bottom

   is used same as scorllToTop method, this method can be eassily implemented using the scrollIntoView method, only by switching the block value to end.

   ```
    const scrollToBottom = (element) => element.scrollIntoView({behaviour: "smooth", block: "end" });
   ```

7. Generate Random Color

   is used to generate the color randomly.

   ````
    const generateRandomHexColor = () => `#${Math.floor(Math.random() * 0xffffff).toString(16)}`
    ```
