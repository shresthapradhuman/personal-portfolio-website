## What is Git?

Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system. 

Git tracks the changes we made to the file, so we have a record of all changes, and we can go to that particular change by reverting that specific version.

Git runs locally and remotely, Where we store our files, changes, and their history in a separate repository. Where we can push and pull changes. Where Git automatically handles and merges the changes for us.

## How we can use Git?

There are two ways to use Git. The first one is from the terminal and the second one is using Git GUI(graphical user interface) such as source tree.

## Things to be known before using GIT.

Repositories: It is a place where all our project files,  changes to files, and history of changes are stored and managed. It can be local or remote.

Add & Commit: This is how git tracks our changes. We add and commit our changes.

Branches: 
Git allows the creation of branches and works separately from others.

Merging:
Git allows merging our changes to other changes. Sometimes there occur conflicts that should be fixed manually.

Pull And Push:
Git pulls allows us to pull the origin branch. Whereas push allows us to push our changes to a particular branch.
